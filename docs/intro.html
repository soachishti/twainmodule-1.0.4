<h1>Overview</h1>

This module, 'twain', provides an interface to the windows 
TWAIN sub-system. The software is available only for windows platforms.
This software is designed to support scanners, digital cameras and audio
equipment which conform to the twain specification.<p>

The twain module also includes a demonstration program, called twexplore.py, 
which can be used to investigate the interface to your twain compatible device.
<p>

<h2>Introduction to TWAIN</h2>

TWAIN is a published API which provides an interface between an application
and a scanner or other source of images. The TWAIN API is maintained and 
developed by TWAIN Working Group, see <a href=http://www.twain.org>
www.twain.org</a>. <p>

The application connects to and communicates with the TWAIN <b>Source Manager</b>
program, which is implemented as twain.dll. The TWAIN Source Manager loads
the program to support the device with which your application needs to communicate.
The program which supports the device is called a <b>Data Source</b>.<p>

The <a href=http://www.twain.org/download.html>TWAIN specification </a> defines
a simple finite-state model for communicating with the TWAIN sub-system. The states
are as follows:<p>

<table summary="Twain Finite-State Model" border=1 width=700>
<tr><td>State Name</td><td>State Description</td><td>Application Activities</td>
<td>Move to next state on</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 - Pre-Session</td><td>Source Manager is not Loaded</td>
<td>None</td><td>Load DLL</td></tr>
<tr><td>2 - Source Manager Loaded</td><td>Source Manager DLL has been
loaded.</td><td>None</td><td>Open Source Manager</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 - Source Manager Open</td><td>Application can communicate with
the source manager</td><td>Can query the list of available sources</td>
<td>Open Source</td></tr>
<tr><td>4 - Source Open</td><td>The source for the appropriate device is
open.</td><td>Application can negotiate the details of the session,
e.g. image format, number of colours etc.</td><td>Request Aquisition of image</td></tr>
<tr><td>5 - Source Enabled</td><td>The source is attempting to acquire
data on behalf of the application</td><td>None</td><td>User/Source produce image</td></tr>
<tr><td>6 - Transfer Ready</td><td>The source has acquired the data on
behalf of the application.</td><td>Begin the transfer.</td><td>Transfer Started.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7 - Transfer in Progress</td><td>The source is transferring the
data to the application.</td><td>Receive data.</td></td></td></tr>
