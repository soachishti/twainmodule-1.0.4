<h1>Using Capabilities</h1>

The TWAIN system allows your application to configure the device using 
<em>capabilities</em>. Capabilities are the options which are available on
the scanner. Your application can query and set the capabilities.

<h2>Querying Capabilities</h2>

In order to query capabilities, you have to create a Source object. 
The following interactive session shows the three functions for 
querying capabilities.<p>

<PRE>
C:\Python22>python
Python 2.2 (#28, Dec 21 2001, 12:21:22) [MSC 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import Tkinter
>>> F=Tkinter.Frame()
>>> import twain
>>> sm=twain.SourceManager(F.winfo_id())
>>> ss=sm.OpenSource()
>>> ss.GetCapability(twain.ICAP_IMAGEFILEFORMAT)
(4, (0, 0, [2, 4, 0]))
>>> ss.GetCapabilityDefault(twain.ICAP_IMAGEFILEFORMAT)
(4, 2)
>>> ss.GetCapabilityCurrent(twain.ICAP_IMAGEFILEFORMAT)
(4, 2)
>>>
</PRE>
<p>
You need to have a window handle before you can create a SourceManager
object. Here, I create a Tk Frame window, and use it's window handle in to
initiate the SourceManager.<p>

The Capabilities are related to the Source, not the SourceManager, so you
have to create a Source object, i.e. you connect to your scanner software.<p>

The Capbililities are defined by numeric constants. The names of the constants
are in the TWAIN specification, chapter 9. There are three groups of
capabilities, CAP_*, ICAP_* and ACAP_*. The CAP_* values are generic capabilities.
The ICAP_* values refer to image-specific capabilities. The ACAP_* values
refer to audio-specific capabilities. These capabilities are defined in the
twain module (for specification version 1.9). In this example we are looking
at the Image File Format capability (ICAP_IMAGEFILEFORMAT).<p>

The <b>GetCapability() method</b> returns the available capabilities. The 
available capabilities are returned in one of four standard containers,
'ONEVALUE', 'RANGE', 'ENUMERATION' or 'ARRAY'. The ICAP_IMAGEFILEFORMAT 
capabities are returned here as an ENUMERATOR. <p>

The ENUMERATION, ONEVALUE and ARRAY are all returned as tuples, where the 
first value is the type of the value. The type of the value is shown in 
the specification (chapter 9). The type used here is type '4', which is
twain.TWTY_UINT16 (unsigned 16bit integer). The type constants are all prefixed
with TWTY_ and are defined in the twain module.<p>

The ENUMERATION indicates that the value has a set of specific, allowed values.
The ENUMERATION includes a tuple with three members. These are, the <em>index</em>
current value of the capability, the <em>index</em> of the default value of the 
capability, and the list of possible values, here 2, 4, 0.
This return value is therefore interpreted as:<br>
<ul>
<li>The ICAP_IMAGEFILEFORMAT is a 16bit integer value.</li>
<li>The current value is 2 (member 0) [twain.TWTY_BMP]</li>
<li>The default value is 2 (member 0) [twain.TWTY_BMP]</li>
<li>The full set of values is 0, 2, 4 [twain.TWTY_TIFF, twain.TWTY_BMP, twain.TWTY_JFIF]</li>
</ul><p>

The <b>GetCapabilityDefault() method</b> returns the default value
of capability. The default capability is normally a single value and is returned
as the second member of the tuple (the first is the type as we said above).
This is the value, to which the capability is set when you connect initially,
or when you <em>reset</em> the capability. <p>

The <b>GetCapabilityCurrent() method</b> returns the current value
of capability. The current capability is normally a single value and is returned
as the second member of the tuple (the first is the type as we said above).<p>


<h2>Setting Capababilities</h2>

Your application can modify the capabilities in three ways:
<ul>
<li> It can set the current value of the capability</li>
<li> It can reset the capability to the default value</li>
<li> It can restrict the set of options available to the user</li>
</ul>
<p>

To set the current value of the capability, use the <b>SetCapability method</b>.
This method take three parameters, the identity of the capabaility (CAP_*,
ICAP_* or ACAP_*), the type of the value (as returned from GetCapabilityCurrent),
and the new value.<p>
<PRE>
>>> ss.GetCapabilityCurrent(twain.ICAP_IMAGEFILEFORMAT, TWTY_UINT16, TWFF_JFIF)
</PRE><p>
This command instructs the scanner to return the image data as JPEG Interchange
file format.<p>

Note that, although the call to SetCabilility may return success, this does
not indicate that the source accepted the value. The source may return
success to indicate that it set it to the 'next best' value. Your application
can retrieve the values from the scanner to verify that it was set as 
expected.<p>

To reset a value to the default value, use the <b>ResetCapability method</b>
This method requires a single argument of the capability identifier.<p>
<PRE>
>>> ss.ResetCapabilityCurrent(twain.ICAP_IMAGEFILEFORMAT)
</PRE><p>

The twain systems supports restricting a capability, i.e. if your application
only support 8bit images, don't allow the user to scan 24bit iamges. This 
functionality is not currently available in the twain module.<p>

<h2>twexplore.py</h2>

The demonstration program <em>twexplore.py</em> allows you to quickly view the
capabilities of your Source. The main screen shows a grid with the 
capability names, their values and their current values. If you double-click
on an item, you are given a dialog, with which you can change the capability.
The grid is refreshed each time a capability is change, so you can see the
impact of the change, i.e. changing units changes the values for dimensions.<p>

<h2>Twain Types</h2>

Parameters passed to the SetCapability must be consistent with the values
expected by the TWAIN API, see chapter 9 of the specification. From the
python perspective, the parameters are passed in the following format:<p>

<table summary="Twain Types to Python Mappings" border=1>
<tr>
<td>TWTY_INT*, TWTY_UINT*, TWTY_BOOL</td>
<td>All of these values are passed as a Python integer or Python long integer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TWTY_FIX32</td>
<td>These values are passed as a Python floating point number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TWTY_FRAME</td>
<td>These values are passed a Python tuple (Left, Top, Right, Bottom).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TWTY_STR*</td>
<td>These values are passed a Python strings.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Wierd Stuff</h2>

The return value from GetCapability() can be in the format of a 'RANGE' or
an 'ARRAY'.<p>

A <b>RANGE</b> is converted to a python dictionary type. Ranges define
values which are flexible within a specific range. There is not type
information returned with a range. It contains 5 values,
'DefaultValue', 'MaxValue', 'MinValue', 'CurrentValue' and 'StepSize'. 
ICAP_XRESOLUTION is an example of a capability which is returned as an
array.<p>
<PRE>
>>> ss.GetCapability(twain.ICAP_XRESOLUTION)
{'StepSize': 1, 'DefaultValue': 150, 'CurrentValue': 150, 'MaxValue': 1600, 
'MinValue': 12}
>>>
</PRE><p>

An <b>ARRAY</b> is a value with no current or default information. It can be
considered as a simple version of the enumerator. It is returned in a tuple,
with the type. The CAP_SUPPORTEDCAPS is returned as an ARRAY.<p>
<PRE>
>>> ss.GetCapability(twain.CAP_SUPPORTEDCAPS)
(4, [4101, 1, 4380, 4364, 4370, 257, 258, 4376, 4388, 4111, 4362, 4103, 4099, 0,
 40963, 64, 64, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
</PRE><p>

The capability ICAP_SUPPORTEDCAPS should list the capabilities supported by
the twain source. The demo program twexplore lists 'Supported Capabilities'
in green.<p>
