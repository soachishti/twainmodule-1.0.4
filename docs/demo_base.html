<h1>Quick Start Base Class</h1>

The distribution contains a demo directory which contains demonstrations for
the wxPython, Tkinter and pyGTK windows toolkits. These demos use a common base
class and a specific sub-class for the target windows toolkit.</p>

<b>Step 1 - OpenScanner</b><p>

The method 'OpenScanner' involves two steps, creating a source manager
object, and creating a source object.<p>

The source manager object is created using the call twain.SourceManager().
The TWAIN protocol uses the client's windows message queue to perform
communication. To access the message queue, the clients window handle is
always passed to the SourceManager constructor. The window handle is
retrieved using the a toolkit specific method.<p>

Once the source manager is opened, the client can get a data source object.
The data source object is retrieve using the factory method, <em>OpenSource</em>.
The data source object is used for all document scanning logic.<p>

When the scanner has an image for the application, the application must
find out that it is available. There are two mechanisms. The client can
Poll the twain source or the application can handle an event. The mechanism
for sending events uses the windows event queue. This can cause problems in
Tkinter. For pyGTK or wxPython you can use either a callback or poll the
source. For Tkinter or other windows libraries you must poll the source.<p>

 
<b>Step 2 - Acquire</b><p>

When the client application wants to acquire a document from the scanner, 
it makes a request to the scanner to acquire the document. This request is
available as a method of the Data Source object, called <em>RequestAcquire</em>.
If you want the scanner user interface to display, pass (1,1) to RequestAcquire
rather than (0,0).
<p>

There are two protocols, acquisition by file or acquisition natively (via windows shared memory).<p>
 
<b>Step 3 - ProcessXFer</b><p>

When the data is available in the server, the client application must 
perform a transfer of that data from the server to the application. The 
application is notified that the image is ready through the 'OnTwainEvent'
method or discovers the data is available by polling the source.<p>

For <b>native image transfer (shared memory) </b>
the image is transferred using the call <em>XferImageNatively</em>. 
XFerImageNatively returns two items (when successful), a windows handle
to a <em>global memory area</em>, which contains the image, and an indicator to
show whether there are more images pending. There will be pending images
where the scanner is using a sheet-feeder.<p>

The global memory areas are not accessible directly from Python. We use a
function (in the twain module), <em>DIBToBMFile</em> to save the image from this global memory
area to a file.  DIBToBMFile stores the image which is in memory to a
windows Bitmap file named tmpfilename. The application then display the
image on the screen.<p>

The application must free the global handle, using the GlobalHandleFree()
method. If the application does not free these handles, the memory
will be unavailable to all windows programs, even after the program exists.<p>

For <b>file based image transfer </b>
the image is transferred using the call <em>XferImageByFile</em>. 
XFerImageByFile creates a file containing the image.<p>

There is a number of complications where the scanner may try to save the
file to an area which cannot be written. The source code tries to retrieve the
filename and handle these sort of problems. These issues are scanner device and
driver specific.<p>

This method uses a method DisplayImage to display the image. This method
is implemented by the toolkit specific subclass.<p>

 <b>Step 4 - Terminate</b><p>
 
The user interface for the scanner software will remain displayed until
the application deletes the data source object. This occurs in the 
<em>MnuQuit</em> method.<p>
 
 Note: The TWAIN software interfaces to your window message queue. If you
 close your window without deleting the Source Manager object, the TWAIN
 software may attempt to write messages to a deleted queue. This may cause
 your program to hang when it attempts to exit.<p>
