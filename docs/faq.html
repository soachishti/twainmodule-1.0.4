<h2>1. Demonstration Programs</h2>

<b>1.1. twexplore.py displays a grey image instead of the image scanned.</b><p>

This problem occurs when the image scanned is very large. If you use the
defaults to scan an A4 page on my HP scanner, you get a 14meg image. This
image does not get displayed by the test program, but it can be viewed using
paint-brush.<p>

You can reduce the size of the data scanned by modifying the size of the
data selected, the pixel type or the resolution. Frame selection is available
as a button on the 'Acquire' screen. Pixel type and resolution are modified
via attributes (i.e. select ICAP_PIXELTYPE or ICAP_XRESOLUTION with double-click
and modify.<p>

<h2>2. General</h2>

<b>2.1. Why does my window go into the background after a Scan.</b><p>

When an image is scanned, the scanner user interface is displayed (or at
least takes some control of the message queue). This is a separate 
process from your application. When the scan is complete, the scanner user 
interface is closed. Windows finds a window to activate in another 
process. <p>

There are some windows messages passed around e.g. WM_ACTIVATE, which
may provide a facility to move the application window to the front.
Alternatively, call the scanner from a modal dialog.<p>
