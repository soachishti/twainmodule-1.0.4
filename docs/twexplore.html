<h1>twexplore</h1>

The twexplore program is intended to allow
a developer to explore the interaction between the twainmodule API and
their TWAIN source. It is particularly useful to identify the quirks of your
data source. <p>

The twexplore program is available either to run as a script from the Python
interpreter or as an executable. The executable does not require a Python 
system to run.<p>

On loading the program, a form is displayed, as show above. The form has 
a menubar, from which all the options are taken, a main pane, which will
show the source capabilities when you connect to the source, and a status
bar. The status bar has three sections, showing the latest message, the 
name of the current source and the current state in the TWAIN state 
concept.<p>

To open a source, select menu->connect. If you have twain source on your
PC, you should see an option list. Select the driver you are interested in.
Once a driver is selected, the source information is displayed in a dialogue.
The TWAIN specification contains information on the meaning of the source
information.<p>

Once the source is open, the source capabilities are displayed on the main
form. Where the attempt to read a capability produced an exception, the
exception is displayed instead of the value. The 'Supported Values' column
shows the result of the GetCapability() operation. This value types can be
seen clearly. The highlighted item (ICAP_PIXELTYPE) displays its capabilties
using an enumerator. The 'Current Value' column shows that the current value
is 2 (from the specification page 336, 2=TWPT_RGB).<p>

Under the TWAIN specification, the data source can give our program the list
of supported capabilities (CAP_SUPPORTEDCAPS). The supported capabilities are
shows in green.<p>

<img src=images/MainScreen.png><p>

By double clicking on a capability a capability editing dialog is show. This
dialog allows you to attempt to set the capability to an arbitrary value.
You enter the value in the dialog box and select the type from the radio-box.
Where the capability can be retrieved, the dialog is initialised to the 
current value of the capability and the type returned by the GetCapabilityCurrent()
request.<p>

The value field is interpreted in the context of the twain module. You can
therefore use both values (e.g. 0) and constants (e.g. TWPT_RGB). The log
message is translated back to the symbolic constant.<p>

You can reset a capability to the default value using the 'Reset Value' button.
After you have changed a capability, you can use the menu option 'File->Refresh Capabilities'
to refresh the main display. <p>

To request an image from the TWAIN device, select the menu option 
'File->Acquire'. You are given the option of displaying the TWAIN source
user interface. If you do not use the twain source user interface, you can
use the Layout dialog to select a frame from the image.<p>

<img src=images/Acquire.png><p>

When the image is available on the Data Source, our application is notified
via a callback and the transfer dialog is displayed. This dialog shows the
information which is available about the image. The twain module supports
two options for transfer of the image 'Transfer Natively', or 'Transfer to File'.
If you select 'Transfer Natively', the image is displayed in a simple frame.
If you select transfer to file, you will be prompted for a filename and file
type. If there are no more images remaining on the Data Source, the Transfer
dialog is closed.<p>
